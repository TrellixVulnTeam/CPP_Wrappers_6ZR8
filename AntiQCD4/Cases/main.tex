    The ratio $\frac{m_0}{E_0}$ determines the length scale to resolve the jet,
    a condition $m_{0}<E_{0}$ is very important for the consistency of our method.\\
    When the ratio is too large, the prongs are smeared towards the edges like in \autoref{fig:case9}.\\
    When the ratio is too small, the prongs are not well resolved like in \autoref{fig:case1}.\\
    A ratio of $\frac{m_0}{E_0}=\frac{1}{2}$ [\autoref{fig:case5}] was chosen as it ``seems'' to correctly resolve the jet, probably this ratio can also be optimized.

    Image formation with a different normalization for $E_0$ is presented in \autoref{fig:caseNorm} (z axis is intentionally left unnormalized so that it can be easily compared with \autoref{fig:case5}), filling the quantity $\frac{\mathbf{E_i}}{E_0}$ correctly normalizes the image.
